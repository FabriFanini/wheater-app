# World Weather App

**World Weather App** is a collaborative project developed with a senior programmer. The goal was to continue learning, grow in the field, and gain experience working as a team. This application allows users to check the weather in any city worldwide by leveraging a weather API.

This was an enriching project where we explored modern technologies and workflows, focusing on building a fully functional and user-friendly weather application.
